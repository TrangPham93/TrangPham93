## Hi👋 I'm Trang.

<!--...me as a human
-->

I'm currently transitioning from a finance career to software development at Hive Coding School, Helsinki.

I hold a Master degree in Finance and worked 5 years as a financial controller. 

I'm experienced in financial data analysis, reports building and automating workflows to reduce errors and increase efficiency.

As a financial controller, I've encountered processes that were time-consuming or prone to errors. I find myself enjoy exploring tools, softwares and scripts that help solve problems more efficiently and eliminate repetitive works. Even without a technical background at the time, I genuinely enjoyed learning new tools, adapting to new ways of extracting data and integrating those improvements to our existing reports. This curiosity is what inspired me to pursue a more technical career path, one I'm graceful to have chosen.  

My other hobbies are swimming 🧜‍♀️, yoga 🧘‍♀️ and crocheting 🧶.

I speaks Vietnamese, English, Finnish and Japanese.
