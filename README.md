My name is Trang.

ðŸªªðŸªª I hold a master degree in finance and currently a student in Hive Helsinki, a coding school.
I have 5 years of experience as financial controller. 
During my work, I found myself increasingly interested in data analytics, understanding the data and making data storytelling insightful. I also love to try and experience the alternative solutions to reduce time spent the boring and repetitive tasks.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on MySQL, Python, C & BI tools.
